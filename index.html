          Hi! I’m <strong>Grace Yu</strong>, a first-year Computer Engineering
          student from Fremont, California. I love to swim, play tennis, read,
          cook, and debate the controversial intricacies of the world - everything
          from whether pineapple belongs on pizza to the merits of pursuing
          extraterrestrial inhabitation. 
        </p>

        <button id="toggle-btn" type="button">Why Bits of Good?</button>

        <p id="extra-text" class="hidden">
          I’m passionate about youth environmental advocacy, particularly 
          through developing and leading engineering projects, educational 
          curricula, and policy teams. More broadly, I'm interested in 
          improving access to learning and educational resources. Being able 
          to do so while enhancing my software development skills is why 
          I'm excited about the chance to join Bits of Good!
